# Nvd-cve-api
# CVE Tracker

A web application that tracks Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React, and Tailwind CSS. This project fetches CVE data from the NVD API, stores it in a MongoDB database, and allows users to view and search CVEs through a web interface.

## Features

- Fetch and store CVE data from the NVD API
- View a list of CVEs with pagination
- Search CVEs by ID, year, score, and last modified date
- View detailed information for a specific CVE
- Responsive and styled UI using React and Tailwind CSS

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- MongoDB

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cve-tracker.git
    cd cve-tracker
    ```

2. **Install server dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    ```

3. **Install client dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```

## Configuration

1. **MongoDB Setup:**

    Make sure MongoDB is running on your machine. You can start MongoDB using the following command:

    ```bash
    mongod
    ```

2. **Environment Variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the following environment variables:

    ```
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/cve-tracker
    NVD_API_URL=https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the server:**

    In the `server` directory, run the following command to start the Express server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`.

2. **Run the client:**

    In the `client` directory, run the following command to start the React development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The client will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

   
## API Endpoints

- **GET /cves**: Retrieve a list of CVEs.
- **GET /cves/:cveId**: Retrieve details of a specific CVE.
- **GET /cves/search**: Search for CVEs based on query parameters.

## Frontend

The frontend is built using React and Tailwind CSS for styling. It includes the following components:

- **CVEList**: Displays a table of CVEs with pagination.
- **CVEDetails**: Displays detailed information for a selected CVE.

## Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is used for styling the frontend. To customize Tailwind CSS, you can modify the `tailwind.config.js` file in the `client` directory.
